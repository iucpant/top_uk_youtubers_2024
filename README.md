# Data Portfolio Excel to Power BI

This is my portfolio website.

# Objective
The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

What is the ideal solution?
To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

1. subscriber count
2. total views
3. total videos, and
4. engagement metrics

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

# Data source
We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

1. channel names
2. total subscribers
3. total views
4. total videos uploaded

Where is the data coming from? The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract).

# Design

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?
   
Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart

# Development

## Data Cleaning

### Transform the data

```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```

### Create the SQL view

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS channel_name, -- 2. 
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```
# Testing

Here are the data quality tests conducted:

## Row count check

```sql
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) are in the SQL view
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024;
```
## Column count check

```sql
/*
# Count the total number of columns (or fields) are in the SQL view
*/


SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS column_count
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024'
```
## Data type check

```sql
/*
# Check the data types of each column from the view by checking the INFORMATION SCHEMA view
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024';
```

## Duplicate count check

```sql
/*
# 1. Check for duplicate rows in the view
# 2. Group by the channel name
# 3. Filter for groups with more than one row
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    channel_name,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024

-- 2.
GROUP BY
    channel_name

-- 3.
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

RETURN totalSubscribers

```

### 2. Total Views (B)
```sql
Total Views (B) = 
VAR billion = 1000000000
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR totalViews = ROUND(sumOfTotalViews / billion, 2)

RETURN totalViews

```

### 3. Total Videos
```sql
Total Videos = 
VAR totalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])

RETURN totalVideos

```

### 4. Average Views Per Video (M)
```sql
Average Views per Video (M) = 
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR sumOfTotalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])
VAR  avgViewsPerVideo = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalViews,sumOfTotalVideos, BLANK())
VAR finalAvgViewsPerVideo = DIVIDE(avgViewsPerVideo, 1000000, BLANK())

RETURN finalAvgViewsPerVideo 

```


### 5. Subscriber Engagement Rate
```sql
Subscriber Engagement Rate = 
VAR sumOfTotalSubscribers = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_subscribers])
VAR sumOfTotalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])
VAR subscriberEngRate = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalSubscribers, sumOfTotalVideos, BLANK())

RETURN subscriberEngRate 

```


### 6. Views per subscriber
```sql
Views Per Subscriber = 
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR sumOfTotalSubscribers = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_subscribers])
VAR viewsPerSubscriber = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalViews, sumOfTotalSubscribers, BLANK())

RETURN viewsPerSubscriber 

```

# Analysis

1. Youtubers with the most subscribers

```sql
/* 

# 1. Define variables 
# 2. Create a CTE that rounds the average views per video 
# 3. Select the column you need and create calculated columns from existing ones 
# 4. Filter results by Youtube channels

### Notes

For this analysis, we'll prioritize analysing the metrics that are important in generating the expected ROI for our marketing client, which are the YouTube channels wuth the most 

- subscribers
- total views
- videos uploaded

## Recommendations 

- What do you recommend based on the insights gathered? 
  
1. Dan Rhodes is the best YouTube channel to collaborate with if we want to maximize visbility because this channel has the most YouTube subscribers in the UK
2. Although GRM Daily, Man City and Yogcasts are regular publishers on YouTube, it may be worth considering whether collaborating with them with the current budget caps are worth the effort, as the potential return on investments is significantly lower compared to the other channels.
3. Mister Max is the best YouTuber to collaborate with if we're interested in maximizing reach, but collaborating with DanTDM and Dan Rhodes may be better long-term options considering the fact that they both have large subscriber bases and are averaging significantly high number of views.
4. The top 3 channels to form collaborations with are NoCopyrightSounds, DanTDM and Dan Rhodes based on this analysis, because they attract the most engagement on their channels consistently.


### Action plan
- What course of action should we take and why?

Based on our analysis, we beieve the best channel to advance a long-term partnership deal with to promote the client's products is the Dan Rhodes channel. 

We'll have conversations with the marketing client to forecast what they also expect from this collaboration. Once we observe we're hitting the expected milestones, we'll advance with potential partnerships with DanTDM, Mister Max and NoCopyrightSounds channels in the future.   

- What steps do we take to implement the recommended decisions effectively?

1. Reach out to the teams behind each of these channels, starting with Dan Rhodes
2. Negotiate contracts within the budgets allocated to each marketing campaign
3. Kick off the campaigns and track each of their performances against the KPIs
4. Review how the campaigns have gone, gather insights and optimize based on feedback from converted customers and each channel's audiences
