# Data Portfolio Excel to Power BI

This is my portfolio website.

# Objective
What is the key pain point?
The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

What is the ideal solution?
To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

1. subscriber count
2. total views
3. total videos, and
4. engagement metrics

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

# Data source
What data is needed to achieve our objective?
We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

1. channel names
2. total subscribers
3. total views
4. total videos uploaded

Where is the data coming from? The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract).

#Development

##Data Cleaning

###Transform the data

```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```

###Transform the data

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS channel_name, -- 2. 
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```
#Testing

Here are the data quality tests conducted:

##Row count check

```sql
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) are in the SQL view
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024;
```
##Column count check

```sql
/*
# Count the total number of columns (or fields) are in the SQL view
*/


SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS column_count
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024'
```
##Data type check

```sql
/*
# Check the data types of each column from the view by checking the INFORMATION SCHEMA view
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024';
```

##Duplicate count check

```sql
/*
# 1. Check for duplicate rows in the view
# 2. Group by the channel name
# 3. Filter for groups with more than one row
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    channel_name,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024

-- 2.
GROUP BY
    channel_name

-- 3.
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#Design

##Dashboard components required

What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?
To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

##Dashboard mockup

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart

#Analysis

1. Youtubers with the most subscribers

```sql
/* 

# 1. Define variables 
# 2. Create a CTE that rounds the average views per video 
# 3. Select the column you need and create calculated columns from existing ones 
# 4. Filter results by Youtube channels
# 5. Sort results by net profits (from highest to lowest)
